### Hello!! 

**I do full stack development in Ruby on Rails** 

Have to say first that I LOVE JS TS REACT although Ruby was my first and the syntax is beautiful.

- 🚀 I’m exploring js packages on 3D animations and designs.
- ❤️ I also love to express my creativity through design, giving the ideas to life gives me so much joy.
- 👯 I have two side projects as my boring-time filler, WishFund and Channel, I have very bold views on them, I would love to collaborate!
- 📫 Trying to glorify my portfolio page https://sencao94.com/ as much as possible.
